## Stellar Metallicities in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies

As a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Alexander Ji, I study the **smallest galaxies in the universe**.  

My recent work focuses on the **ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Segue 1**, using **Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS)** spectroscopy to measure stellar metallicities and reconstruct its **metallicity distribution function (MDF)**.  

Currently, I am also contributing to the **re-calibration of the Ca II triplet (CaT)** and **Ca II K (CaK)** metallicity indicators, refining empirical relations that connect spectroscopic indices to [Fe/H].

I also have contributed to the analysis of the Milky Way satellite **Ursa Major III/Unions 1**, combining **Pan-STARRS1 DR2 photometry** and LRIS spectroscopy to determine metallicities for 12 member stars and place constraints on the system's metallicity dispersion.

## Senior Thesis — The Initial Mass Function of Early-Type Galaxies

At **Princeton University**, I investigated the **initial mass function (IMF)** of massive elliptical galaxies using spectroscopy from the **MASSIVE Survey** and molecular gas observations from **ALMA**, advised by **Prof. Jenny Greene**.

## Star Formation Efficiency in Superthin Galaxies

As an **International Internship Program (IIP)** intern at **Cardiff University** in 2022, I worked with **Dr. Timothy Davis** to determine the **star formation efficiency** of 14 superthin spiral galaxies using **ALMA CO(1–0)** observations.  

We found that these galaxies exhibit systematically lower efficiencies than typical spirals, supporting the theory that **superthin galaxies are stabilized by compact dark matter halos**.

## X-ray Variability of Sgr A\*

During my **Junior Paper** and **Undergraduate Summer Research Program (USRP)** projects with **Dr. Lena Murchikova** and **Dr. Neta Bahcall**, I analyzed **NICER** x-ray data of the Galactic Center to study variability during the **2018 S0-2 star flyby**, finding evidence of **flare-like activity near Sgr A\***.

## Biosignatures in Exoplanet Atmospheres

For my **Spring Junior Paper**, advised by **Dr. Adam Burrows**, I reviewed the most promising atmospheric biosignatures and evaluated **JWST’s** sensitivity to detect both common and trace gases including **chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)**.

## NuMED for Children — Pediatric Cardiac Stent Design

Supported by the **John C. Bogle ’51 Fellowship**, I interned at **NuMED for Children, Inc.** in 2020, contributing to the development and testing of a new pediatric cardiac stent that later received **FDA approval in 2021**.
