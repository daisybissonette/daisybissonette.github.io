## ðŸŒ  Teaching Philosophy

# Teaching has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my journey in astrophysics.  
# I enjoy helping students build confidence in physics and astronomy by connecting abstract concepts to intuitive understanding and real-world phenomena. I aim to create inclusive and supportive learning environments where curiosity drives engagement and discovery.
