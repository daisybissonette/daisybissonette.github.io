## Philosophy

Outreach is central to how I engage with science. I believe that sharing astronomy with the public and creating inclusive academic spaces are both essential to building a field that represents the diversity of the universe we study.

## University of Chicago — Community Engagement & Outreach

At Chicago, I lead EDI and outreach both within and beyond the scope of the Astronomy and Astrophysics department. Some projects I have been a part of include organizing bias-awareness workshops, community discussions, and policy updates to improve belonging in academic spaces.

As part of the **Community Engagement Working Group** in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, I help coordinate outreach events such as the **South Side Science Festival** and the **South Side Astronomy Art Contest**, which bring together scientists, students, and Chicago residents through science and creativity.  

I also gave a **Lifelong Learning Talk** at Chicago’s **Blackstone Public Library**, where I led an interactive lecture for senior citizens about how astronomers use spectroscopy to study the universe.

## Past Outreach and Equity-focused Work

My work with the **PhET Simulations DEIB Advisory Board** at the **University of Colorado Boulder** focused on developing inclusive frameworks and design strategies for STEM education tools used by millions of students worldwide.  

At **Princeton**, I was a member of the **Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) Local Organizing Committee**, helping plan programming, recruit speakers, and promote inclusivity in the physical sciences.  
I also served on the **Council of Science and Technology (CST) Student Advisory Board**, where I helped design and run events aimed at improving science literacy across the campus community.

Additionally, I was the **Events Chair for the group Towards an Inclusive Community of Undergraduate Physicists** (formerly *Undergraduate Women in Physics*), where I helped organize discussions, mentoring programs, and inclusive community-building events.
