Originally from Upstate New York near the Canadian border, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. I completed my A.B. in Astrophysical Sciences with honors at Princeton University in 2023.

My research focuses on measuring stellar metallicities in the faintest dwarf galaxies, using low-to-medium resolution spectroscopic observations to understand the earliest phases of galaxy formation. I currently am advised by Prof. Alexander Ji at UChicago.

Outside of research, I love kayaking, running, and watercolor painting. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
